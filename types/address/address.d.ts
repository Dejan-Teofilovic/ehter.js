/**
 *  Returns a normalized and checksumed address for %%address%%.
 *  This accepts non-checksum addresses, checksum addresses and
 *  [[getIcapAddress]] formats.
 *
 *  The checksum in Ethereum uses the capitalization (upper-case
 *  vs lower-case) of the characters within an address to encode
 *  its checksum, which offers, on average, a checksum of 15-bits.
 *
 *  If %%address%% contains both upper-case and lower-case, it is
 *  assumed to already be a checksum address and its checksum is
 *  validated, and if the address fails its expected checksum an
 *  error is thrown.
 *
 *  If you wish the checksum of %%address%% to be ignore, it should
 *  be converted to lower-case (i.e. ``.toLowercase()``) before
 *  being passed in. This should be a very rare situation though,
 *  that you wish to bypass the safegaurds in place to protect
 *  against an address that has been incorrectly copied from another
 *  source.
