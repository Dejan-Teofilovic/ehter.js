/**

 *  This is responsibile for converting much of the various
 *  loose network values into a concrete ethers-ready value.
 *
 *  For example, converting addresses to checksum addresses,
 *  validating a hash is 32 bytes, and so on.
 *
 *  By sub-classing this class and providing it in a custom
 *  Network object this allows exotic (non-Ethereum) networks
 *  to be fairly simple to adapt to ethers.
